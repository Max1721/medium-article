        As we shared in our previous post, Tom and I started working on a side project called PixelMe a few months ago. After creating a landing page in Bali and attracting our first subscribers, we didnâ€™t really know where we wanted to go with it. But we did know we wanted to have fun, build a sideline business with minimal effort, test out our own marketing strategies and potentially add a new revenue stream for the three of us.
Shortly after launching our solitary landing page, we were contacted by Appsumo to run a 14-day deal for their community. If you donâ€™t know Appsumo, itâ€™s essentially a group buying service for businesses. Aiming to level the playing field somewhat, it enables smaller players to afford enterprise-grade tools and software at a reduced price by leveraging the purchasing power of many. Every month, they promote eight tools to their community of more than 800,000 entrepreneurs and start-ups ðŸ˜±. The only drawback is that they only offer lifetime memberships and deals, which might sound a little crazy at first, especially when youâ€™re trying to build a product from scratch and get some recurring revenue.
Let me share the story of our experience with Appsumo and their community of Sumolings (a moniker given to all Appsumo subscribers).

As you can see below, Appsumo provides a fairly elementary partner dashboard.
